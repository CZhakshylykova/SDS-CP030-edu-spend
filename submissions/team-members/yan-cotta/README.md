## Key Findings from EDA

### Dataset Overview

- Total records: 907 education programs across multiple countries
- Features include country, city, university, program, tuition fees, living costs, and more
- No missing values identified in the dataset

### Cost Distribution Analysis

- Tuition fees vary significantly across countries, with the US, UK, and Australia showing higher average costs
- Higher degree levels (PhD, Masters) generally have higher tuition fees than Bachelors programs
- Living cost indices correlate strongly with rent prices across different cities

### Correlation Highlights

- Moderate positive correlation between tuition fees and living costs (r ≈ 0.45)
- Strong correlation between rent costs and total living expenses (r ≈ 0.82)
- Exchange rates show inverse relationship with some cost indicators

### Total Cost of Attendance (TCA)

- Successfully engineered TCA metric combining tuition, rent, insurance and visa fees
- Countries with highest TCA: USA, UK, Australia, Canada
- Programs with highest TCA: Medical, Business, Engineering

### Outliers

- Identified several high-cost outlier programs, primarily in medical and business fields
- Approximately 8% of tuition fees and 6% of rent costs classified as outliers
- Outliers were retained for modeling to maintain real-world cost variability

## Key Findings from Model Development (Phase 2)

- **Model Performance**: Developed a Random Forest Regressor capable of predicting Total Cost of Attendance (TCA) with an R² score of approximately 0.82 on the test set. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was around $6,420.
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation confirmed the model's stability, yielding an average R² of ~0.81, MAE of ~$6,550, and RMSE of ~$9,990.
- **Key Predictors**: The most influential features in predicting TCA include `Rent_USD`, `Country_United States`, `Living_Cost_Index`, `Country_Australia`, `Country_United Kingdom`, and degree levels (e.g., `Level_PhD`, `Level_Masters`).
- **Practical Application**: A function was developed to allow for sample TCA predictions based on user inputs, demonstrating the model's utility.
- **Data Handling**: Successfully loaded and prepared data, including a strategy for handling the high-cardinality 'City' feature by simplifying it.

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 3: Advanced Modeling & Deployment**
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model.
   - Experiment with other regression algorithms (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
   - Develop an interactive web application or dashboard for users to get personalized cost estimates.
   - Consider incorporating more data sources or features to further enhance prediction accuracy.

## Notes

- The notebook includes comprehensive error handling for missing data files
- All visualizations are designed to work with the expected dataset structure
- The TCA calculation adapts to available data columns

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated
2. Verify the dataset is placed in the correct location
3. Check that all packages are installed: `pip list`
4. Restart the Jupyter kernel if needed
